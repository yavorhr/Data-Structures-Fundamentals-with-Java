# Data Structures Fundamentals (with Java) - Februray 2022

## Course Description

The course [Data Structures Fundamentals with Java](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3671/data-structures-fundamentals-with-java-february-2022) introduces the participants to the most used data structures in programming by laying a solid foundation, a lot of practical work and useful theory. You will learn about the implementation of **lists**, **queues**, **stacks**, **trees** and some algorithms such as recursive depth crawl (**DFS** - Depth-First Search) and breadth crawl (**BFS** - Breadth-First Search). The students will learn to work not only with ready-made program libraries, but also to **implement your own structures**. All participants will gain knowledge on how to judge **when and which data structure to use by analyzing the complexity of the algorithms** for each of the operations.

## Acquired skills

- Evaluation and complexity of algorithms
- Representation of **tree data structures**
- **Depth Crawl** (DFS) and **Width Crawl** (BFS)
- **Binary and balanced trees** and their application
- **Priority queues** and implementation of operations with them
- Implementation of **linear data structures**

## Course content
